# 2. USER STORY
Story Name: Employment 
<div align="justify">  
Description: A user can post, create a resume then search a desired job depending upon his skill, education and experience. Similarly, a company can post a job and find candidate depending upon his requirement.
<div>



### Acceptance Criteria of total project:
<B>Functional:</B>
-	A user can upload resume or create resume from our application
-	A company can post new job openings
-	A user can search job
-	Company can search candidate
-	User have to login before apply for job
-	Company have to login to post a job

<B> Non-functional: </B>
-	A user can limit who can see her resume and company can search candidate.
-	A user/company can login by their google accounts
-	Recommend Job and give notifications of job to candidate based on their skill

We have a total of four tasks related to DevOps work. We need to convert them into user stories and write acceptance criteria for each, as follows:
1.	Task 1: Implement Continuous Integration Pipeline
2.	Establish Deployment Automation
3.	Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
4.	Enhance Monitoring and Alerting

### 2.1 User Story of task 1: Implement Continuous Integration Pipeline
2.1.1 Description: 
<div align="justify">  
As a Devops engineer, I need a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to automatically integrate and validate code changes. I also need to maintain an efficient workflow of integration pipeline not only during initial development but also when adding new features, fixing bugs.
</div>
2.1.2 Acceptance Criteria:
-  Our CI pipeline must follow steps like code compilation, testing, and validation
-  CI pipeline must have feature of code integration and version-control
-  CI should follow the units and integration test of function before deploying into the production
-  The CI pipeline should trigger automatically on each code commit.
-  It should provide notifications, messages, and logs to developers and us on build outcomes for effective troubleshooting.

2.1.3 Estimation:
Baseline: 2 weeks

2.1.4 Reason:  
<div align="justify">  
The project involves complex functionalities such as user resume management, job posting, and tailored search mechanisms. Implementing features like resume uploads, job searches, and user/company logins require meticulous development and testing. Additionally, incorporating non-functional aspects like privacy controls, Google account integration, and personalized job recommendations adds intricacy. The two-week timeline allows for thorough coding, testing, and integration conforming to acceptance criteria, ensuring a robust and well-structured system.
</div>

### 2.2 User Story 2: Establish Deployment Automation
2.2.1 Description: 
<div align="justify">  
As a Devops engineer, I want to automate deployment process to ensure consistent, error-free releases with less effort in repeated identical tasks. I will minimize production downtime and error by avoiding manual deployments as done in previous releases while delivering the new releases.
</div>
  
2.2.2 Acceptance Criteria:
-  Our scripts should automate the new release and deployment the code upon successful build and integration is performed by developer/devops in the CI pipeline
-  Our scripts should be error-free for performing regular repeated tasks during deployments and must include rollback functionality in case of any errors.
-  Our script should generate and store logs in our custom directory for auditing, problem analysis and troubleshooting later.

2.2.3 Estimation:
Baseline: 3 weeks
2.2.4 Reason:
<div align="justify">  
The two-week timeline is justified for a project involving user resume management, job posting, and search functionalities, along with non-functional features. Using Ansible for deployment automation, the scripts ensure seamless release, error-free repeated tasks, and logging for auditing and troubleshooting. Ansible's capabilities contribute to efficient and reliable deployment processes in line with project requirements.
</div>

### 2.3 User Story 3: Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
2.3.1 Description: 
<div align="justify">  
As a DevOps engineer, I implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to minimize resources (time, human) consumption to allocate and manage infrastructure. I have to create templates, version control through tools like Terraform and Ansible for infrastructure deployment.
</div>div

2.3.2 Acceptance Criteria:
-  Infrastructure components should be defined using IaC tools (Terraform, Ansible, chef).
-  Provisioning and deprovisioning should be automated via IaC rather than manual.
-  Manual intervention must have to minimized while deploying and update infrastructure to reduce error, effort, time.
-  A historical record of version control changes should be tracked and stored through IaC to identify modifications of infrastructure

2.3.3 Estimation:
Baseline: 4 weeks

2.3.4 Reason:
<div align="justify"> 
The two-week timeline for the project is justified due to its complexity, encompassing features like resume management, job posting, and search functionalities. Incorporating Terraform as an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool streamlines deployment processes, providing versioned and consistent infrastructure. This timeframe allows for comprehensive coding, testing, and integration, ensuring the implementation of robust features and meeting acceptance criteria for automated releases, error-free deployments, and efficient logging practices.
</div>

### 2.4 User Story 4: Enhance Monitoring and Alerting
2.4.1 Description: 
<div align="justify"> 
As an operations team member, I want to enhance system monitoring and alerting capabilities for proactive issue identification and resolution.
</div>

2.4.2 Acceptance Criteria:
-  Server had to be Prepared for storing alerts, notifications, logs, and trap messages sent by various infrastructure or resources such as network, server, storage, and applications.
-  Monitoring tools (e.g. Zabbix, Prometheus, Grafana, Nagios) have to be Set up and install for tracking statistics for those resources.
-  Threshold values should be created to send alerts (warning, down, and up) based on the performance of resources.
-  Review of monitoring tools should be done periodically to know update about tools are working properly or not.

2.4.3 Estimation:
Baseline: 2 weeks

2.4.4 Reason: 
<div align="justify"> 
The two-week timeline for the project is justified considering the comprehensive features, including resume management and job functionalities. The complexity increases with non-functional requirements such as privacy controls and Google account integration. For deployment automation, tools like Grafana and Zabbix are instrumental in setting up a robust monitoring system. The acceptance criteria ensure a systematic approach to infrastructure monitoring, with Grafana and Zabbix supporting the tracking of resource statistics and alerting mechanisms. This timeframe allows for thorough coding, testing, and integration, providing a reliable system with periodic reviews to ensure continuous monitoring effectiveness.

The Agile software development model is a method of developing software by breaking down large tasks into small chunks in an iterative manner while focusing on continuous collaboration and improvements /updates. It is used in cases where requirements and solutions are unknown or may vary based on clientâ€™s or project demands. We not only split project tasks but also break down the overall project completion duration into small, manageable time-boxed iterations (may be 1 to 4 weeks) called sprints for continuous improvement and easy management.
